Are you looking for Beginners Guide to Warframe or perhaps just here to refresh your memory?

I'm Tipsy, and in this new series, we’ll be creating a brand-new Warframe account and going through everything you need for a complete beginner guide to the game.

The goal of this series is to take a completely free-to-play account from the very beginning all the way to the latest content—which, at the time of recording, is Warframe 1999. And For future updates, we’ll pick up right where we left off.

This guide will be made to help new or returning players navigate everything they might encounter. If there’s something you know now that you wish you had known earlier, feel free to leave a comment below to help others out. Additionally, if there’s a topic you’d like me to cover as the series progresses, let me know in the comments. I’ll will use your feedback to shape the series into something that’s is both useful and helpful for everyone new and old players alike.

Each video in the series will be split into chapters, making it easy to follow along or skip to specific sections you’re interested in.

Before we dive in, I do want to mention that there’s a referral link down below. If you do have friends who already play Warframe, feel free to use their referral link when creating your account. Doing so will grant you a 7-day Affinity Booster to help level up your items and Warframes faster (essentially this is a XP booster for your gear in warframe).

Finally, here is the agenda for the first epsiode. You can also use the timestamps in the video to jump between chapters as we go, and hopefully you enjoy the video.
So lets get into it:

**Chapter 1**: Beginning your Warframe Journey (Which frame to start with)
---
As you boot up Warframe for the first time, you’ll be introduced to three starter Warframes and will need to choose one.

Keep in mind that all of these frames are relatively easy to farm early in the game. So, even if you pick one that doesn’t suit your playstyle, you can always farm another. Since each of these Warframes is accessible early on, I highly recommend choosing the one you think will be the most fun for you personally.

You can read about each Warframe’s abilities and watch a short preview clip, but here’s a summary of each:

### **Excalibur**
Excalibur is a more melee-focused Warframe. It comes with a passive ability that grants a 10% bonus to attack speed and damage when using certain melee weapons, such as swords, nikanas, and rapiers.

Excalibur’s abilities complement melee combat very well:
- with first ability the **Slash Dash**: A gap-closer that lets you dash through enemies the close cap between you and your enemies.
- The **Radial Blind**: A blinding ability that disables nearby enemies. making it easy the melee enemies without taking much damage
- then the **Radial Javelin**: A ranged attack that hits multiple enemies. and also can ensnare enemies hit by it again making melee easier for you.
- lastly we have the**Exalted Blade**: which Summons a powerful energy sword that can be modded like any other weapon in the game. and with the correct mods can be pretty powerful.
so If you enjoy melee combat, Excalibur is a solid and fun choice. for that.

### **Volt**
The secound frame Volt is one of Warframe’s speed-focused frames. His passive ability which charges up every meter you move, adding 10 electricity damage to your next attack for every meter traveled, up to a maximum of 1000 bonus damage. While this isn’t very strong later in the game, it can be helpful early on.

Volt’s abilities provide a versatile toolkit with a speed buff:
- the **Shock**:  is A ranged stun ability with AoE damage.
- then you have your **Speed**: ability which Boosts your movement speed and reload speed for its duration.
- then there is your**Electric Shield**: which Creates a shield that provides cover and enhances your weapon damage when shooting through it. You can also carry the shield.
- lastly**Discharge**: which is a AoE ability that stuns and damages all enemies within range.
If you like a mix of utility, speed, and crowd control, Volt is a very interesting choice for that.

### **Mag**
And lastly we have Mag who is a more ability-focused Warframe. Her passive ability vacuums up pickups within an 8-meter radius. While this is useful at first, it becomes obsolete once you get a companion with the Vacuum mod (which we’ll cover later as you get access to this pretty early in the game).

Mag’s abilities include:
- the **Pull**: ability which Ragdolls and stuns enemies, gathering them into one spot for easy elimination.
- the secound ability**Magnetize**: Has two functions:
    - one is**Taping**: the ability to Creates a field that snares and damages enemies over time. a you can shoot this to buff the damage over time to the enemy
    - on the otherhand is **Holding**: the ability which Generates a field around you that absorbs ranged attacks and reflects damage back to them.
- then there is**Polarize**: which Depletes enemy shields or armor while restoring shields for you and your allies. This becomes increasingly useful once enemeis begins to have some extra armor and shields.
- lasty we have **Crush**: which is a AoE damage ability that crushes enemies in range.

Mag’s abilities provide excellent crowd control and utility, making her a great choice for ability-focused players.
but early on could suffer abit from enegery regen as each abilty cast cost energy. 

---

Overall, I recommend choosing whichever Warframe you find most fun since you can farm all three within your first week of playing. For me, I’ll be going with **Volt** this time, as his speed boost will help me clear missions a little faster.

---

**Chapter 2**: Warframe Settings. 
---
Before we dive fully into the game, I want to quickly go over a few settings that can enhance your gameplay experience. While I won’t cover all of my settings here, I’ll provide a link below with screenshots of my complete setup, including graphics settings, for those who want to match them.
### **Settings to Consider Adjusting**

#### **Sensitivity**
Warframe’s default sensitivity is extremely high, so I recommend adjusting it to a level that feels comfortable for you. For **Railjack** and **Archwing** sensitivity, you can leave them as they are for now and tweak them later once you reach that point in the game.
- Melee with fire weapon input

#### **Social Tab**
Since I’ll be playing free-to-play (F2P), I disable **gifts from other players** under the social tab. Warframe allows players to send various items as gifts, but I prefer to turn this off for a more self-reliant experience.

#### **Locked Minimap Rotation**
Under the **Interface** tab, there are many options to customize, but one change I make is locking the **minimap rotation**. This keeps the minimap fixed rather than rotating as you move, which I personally find easier to navigate.

#### **Video Settings**
In the **Video** section, I adjust the :
- **Field of View (FOV)** to the maximum, as I prefer the wider perspective.
- Under **Advanced Settings**, I disable:
    - **Motion Blur**
    - **Depth of Field**
    - **Distortions**
    - **Film Grain**  
        This creates a cleaner and sharper visual experience, which I personally enjoy.

#### **Accessibility+**
Finally, under the **Accessibility** tab, I adjust these settings:
- **Fire Manual Trigger Weapons**: Enable this to allow holding down the fire button on weapons that would normally require tapping. This makes manual weapons function like automatic ones, which can be very convenient.
- **Screen Shake**: Disable this for smoother gameplay, especially during intense fights.
- **Enemy Highlights**: Add a subtle highlight to enemies. This is particularly useful for spotting enemies in darker areas, making combat a bit easier.
### **Final Notes**
These are the main settings I like to tweak, but remember, all of this is based on personal preference. I encourage you to experiment and find what works best for you.

For those interested, I’ll leave a link to a screenshot of my full settings, so you can use it as a reference or starting point

**Chapter 3:** The Introduction Mission: (Objective, Movement and Choices)
---
### **Basic mission Knowlag**
Once you’ve chosen your Warframe, you’ll be placed into the game’s starter quest and tutorial. Here, your main objective will be to follow the **yellow waypoint**, which indicates the mission’s current goal. The yellow marker will turn **red** when you have an active target (or targets) to eliminate and will turn **green** to guide you to the extraction point at the end of the mission.

At this point, you might also be experiencing Warframe’s **movement system** for the first time which I absolutely love. Here are some quick tips to help you get familiar with the movement mechanics:
### **Movement Basics**
Warframe offers a few unique movement abilites which are the: **Bullet Jump**, **Slide**, **Aim Glide**, and **Dodge Roll**. and Here’s how they work:

- So the **Bullet Jump**:  works when you Crouch (with CTRL) and press jump to perform a bullet jump, launching yourself in the direction you’re looking.
- The **Slide**: happens when you Sprint and hold crouch while moving to slide.
- the **Aim Glide**: is While in the air, you can hold aim with right click to glide and slow your descent a little bit
- and then you have the **Dodge Roll**: which happen when you Tap your dodge button and can also be used if you just tap your sprint button once  to roll and maintain momentum. 

You can combine these moves for more efficient traversal in warframe by:

1. **Sprint → Slide → Bullet Jump -Into- Double Jump/Aim Glide/Dodge Roll while in the air** before landing.
2. you can then Repeat the sequence for faster movement around mission in warframe

This might feel a bit tricky at first if you’re new to the game, but with practice, it will become second nature. For now, just play around with the movement system and have fun. Even sticking to a simple **Slide → Bullet Jump → Double Jump** is more than enough to move around quickly when starting out.
### **Wall Latch**
There is also the wall latch which is Another trick: if you’re near a wall, hold aim button to latch onto it, allowing you to hang on for a short time. This can help with wall climbing, gaining better control while navigating walls, or even setting up for a better jump.

_(Show clips of movement mechanics and objectives here)_

you will also be intruduced to this while playing the introduction mission so now  just  follow the yellow markers, using your newly learned movement abilites to your next task which will be to choose your beginner weapons.

### **Choices In Warframe**
Throughout the introduction mission, you’ll have the opportunity to choose a **melee**, **secondary**, and **primary weapon** to carry out of the mission. Don’t stress too much about your choices here, as all these weapons can be purchased later using credits, with no crafting time required, making it easy to swap them out.
Here’s what I’ll be picking and why, but feel free to choose based on your preferences:

- for the **Melee Weapon**: I’ll be choosing the **Bo staff**, as it has a decent combo set and feels great to use. However, if you’ve chosen **Excalibur**, you might want to go with the sword instead, as Excalibur’s passive ability grants **10% attack speed** and **10% bonus damage** for swords, nikanas, and rapiers. The Bo won’t benefit from this passive.

- and for the **Secondary Weapon**: I’ll be going with the gun. I likely won’t use my secondary much in the early game, so this choice isn’t too critical for me right now.

- lastly for the **Primary Weapon**: I’ll be selecting the **Paris bow**. cause Bows in warframe are incredibly strong in the early game due to their high raw damage output, which is a pretty nice before we get started with upgrading or modding our weapons.

If you like, you can follow the same choices I’m making, or you can pick the weapons that appeal most to your playstyle.

Once you reach this spot you will be promted to hack, and this is a little hacking mini game where enemy faction in the game has their own minigame connceted to it. and this is the Greenir mini here you want to ativate all the spots with your space bar. and they become harder the further you get in the game.

With that covered, I’ll leave you to finish the rest of the introduction mission. Use this time to get a feel for Warframe and its mechanics.

---

**Chapter4**: The Obiter and Main System (Daily Tribute, Inbox, Arsenal, Navigation)
---
### **Daily Tribute**

Once you complete the first mission, you’ll be introduced to the **Daily Tribute** system, which is Warframe's login reward feature. Each day you log in, you’ll receive a reward, and your total login count will increase over time.

And Every 50 days, you’ll receive milestone rewards, which are typically pretty good. These give you something to look forward to as you continue to log in. you can check the milestone rewards on the warframe wiki

Also If you miss a day or take a break, don’t worry! Your login count won’t reset or go down. When you return, your progress resumes right where you left off.

### **Activating Cross-Play**
After taking your reward you You will properly be prompted to activate **Cross-Play**, and I highly recommend enabling it. Cross-Play lets you use your account across different platforms. Also i do belive that if you are on console you will have to enable cross play to a pc account to be able to trade with PC players. As you had to do this when cross play was first intruduced. But it might be changed now tho.

### **Check Your Inbox**
Now is also a good idea to check your **Inbox**, which is found under the **Communications** menu. as Digital Extremes often sends out rewards, so there might be something waiting for you.

If you used a referral link (like the one in the description when creating your account), you’ll also find your **7-day booster** here. This can significantly speed up your early progress.

### **The Orbiter**
and with that corved you’ll find yourself in the **Orbiter**, which is your main base of operations in Warframe. However, at this stage, it’s damaged. and The next few quests will guide you through repairing it by completing missions to unlock new features for the obiter.

**Arsenal**  
The first section you unlock is the **Arsenal**, which serves as your hub for customizing loadouts, upgrading weapons, and changing appearances. While it isn’t fully functional yet (since you need to unlock the **Mod Station**), you’ll still use it.

If you want to switch weapons, you’ll notice only a few are available for **Credits**. as Most are sold for **Platinum** (Warframe’s premium currency), but you can avoid spending Platinum by crafting weapons.

To do this, simply double-click a weapon to open the **Market**. Here, you’ll see:
- **Platinum Purchase**: which is Not recommended, as it’s expensive and unnecessary.
- but the**Blueprint Option**: which costs Credits (e.g., 20,000 Credits) and allows you to buy the blueprint that can craft the weapon using resources gathered in missions.

Crafting is the primary way to obtain weapons in Warframe. Some weapons require additional parts that are dropped from specific enemies or missions, which we’ll cover later.

Also You might have notinced by now that you start with **50 free Platinum**, which cannot be traded with other players. but try to Avoid spending it on weapons or cosmetics. Instead, save it for **Warframe slots** and **weapon slots**, which we’ll discuss in more detail later on.
But to keep it short each weapon and frame cost a slot and you do not have infinte slots at the begining so you will be limited to have a certain amount of frames and weapons thill you buy more slots. to expand your arsenal

### **Navigation**

Next, simple follow the quest and head to your **Navigation Station**, which is the **Star Chart**. The Star Chart serves as the main map of Warframe, where you’ll select mission nodes.
- Each planet has a series of mission nodes on it which can be completed and to travel to the next plant you will have to complete a node called a junction.
- To unlock a node, you must complete the node before it.
- but You can join friends or other players in missions you haven’t unlocked yet which is called using a taxi

For now, focus on the main questline, which will guide you through missions on Earth and help repair your Orbiter, unlocking all its stations.
### **Main Progression**

and Here is a quick summary of your early-game goals as of this stage in the game:
1. first **Follow the Main Questline**: This will introduce you to key mechanics, unlock new features, and guide you to Syndicates and other vital systems.
2. and while doing this **Complete Nodes**: Even if the questline doesn’t require it, clearing nodes on the Star Chart helps progress toward unlocking the **Steel Path**, a harder mode which requires all nodes to be completed on the star chart.
Clearing nodes early is a great habit that will benefit you in the long run.

---

**Chapter 5**: Restoring the Obiter Codex and looting resources in missions. 
---
Now its time to restore your Obiter so you can use the different mechanics the game the game has to offer.
So head to the navigation system and start the mission on earth to begin the quest.

The game should help you on what to do in the missions so just follow the yellow marker and you should be good.

### **Resources and looting**
But some things to be on the lookout for is resources as you can already begin to find some.
Each planet in warframe has diffrent resources to offer and some are more common than others. 
so when going by containers or loot nodes i highly recommend desterying them, but dont nessarcly have to go out of your way for them as of yet but if a container is on your patch why not get some free loot right.

You can also stumple upon a kubrow den i highly recommned destroying them as there is a chance for certain pet mods to drop but also a kubrow egg which can be made into a kubrow companion for you in the future if it drops.

Once you have complete the first mission you should have gotten some mods and resources you looted thuout the mission but you also be rewarded with the comms segment which we use to restore the Codex in the obiter.
You might notice that you frame and weapon have gotten affinity and properly leveled up abit. we will go over this a bit more later but for now to keep it short basicly every time you level up a weapon or frame for first time you will get mastery for that and mastery in warframe is connected to your level or Mastery rank which is pretty importent and we will cover that once we reach the point where we will need to rank up.

### **Codex**
With the mission complete you can now go and install your Codex station and this station is pretty importent as this is the place you will begin quests in warframe but you can also use it to check general data and read about some lore and diffrent things in warframe.
I highly recommend taking a look at the Training and Missions tap as these will give you some basic infomation on some of the main mechanics and missions of warframe. As the guides goes on we will cover some it but feel free to check the tabs so you have better understanding on some of the systems. 

And as mentioned this is the place to start quest and your first quest is gonna be Vor's Prize doing this quest you will gather the last segments for your obiter so just get it started right off the bat and follow it complete your obiter.

---
**Chapter 6**: Vor's Prize - (Mod Segment and upgrading Weapons and frames)
---
So as we now have the Codex we now know that the Quest we are doing is called Vor's Prize so lets just continue doing the quest we now will be the next node. In this mission you will have to save Darvo and this the introduction to the rescue type missions so just go and save Darvo and Exctrat with darvo. If gets killed you have a small amount of time to revive him and continue onwards.

Like the first mission where you unlocked the Codex this mission will unlock the Mods Segment which will give you access to upgrade your weapons and frame.

### **Upgrading weapons & frames**

So once the Mod Segment has been installed head to the arsenal and you can now upgrade frames and weapons. 


So modding in warframe can be pretty complicated and for a new player overwealming which is why i also will show basicly all builds i use so you can follow along and try to explain why im using the build im using. But feel free to experminte cause modding in warframe the is the bigest power progression in the game. 

So some things you need to know about modding.
**Capacity**
First is capacity which can be seen at the top left side the capacity is how much you put on this weapon or frame as a weapon or frame levels up you will gain capacity extra up till lvl 30 where the weapon or frame will have a max capacity of 30, you can than also put in a orokin catalyst or reactor to double this capacity to 60 and there is also something called forming where you reset the weapon and level it back up again but you will now have a extra polartiy

**Polarity**
So as you might notice each mod has a number and a sigel at the top right of the mod this indicates the mod cost and which porlarity it belongs to. And the mod slots on the weapon also might have some polarites so if you match a mod with the correct polarity the mod will cost half the capacity but on the other hand if you put a wrong match it will cost  capacity this will be indiacted on the mod cost by either showing green for half cost or red for extra cost.

You can also upgrade mods by holding right click on the mod and speding a currency called endo and credits to level the mod but keep in mind that the mod capacity cost will also increase with the increase stats. So just keep a eye out and dont just upgrade things you dont need to. 

so now that we understand modding a little bit we will just throw on some things as currently we do not have much capacity, as we will need to level our frame and weapons more..
### **Mods**
And before we continue you can also have a look at the mods station here you will see all your mods but you can also sell mods or dissolve mods for endo ontop this you can combine 4 mods and some credits to basicly roll for a better mod.
and you can also fusion the mods which as we mentioned before upgraded mod.

I highly recommend never selling mods for credits as credits are easy to come by while on the hand endo will be more worth it. also dont sell or dissovle a mod you only have one of as you might need later so you basicly want to try and have atleast minimun 1 of each mod and maybe more if you want to have mods at diffrent levels. 
There is also a spot claled ayatan treasures but this is something for later, if you want to see more on ayatan sculptures and how they work i do have a video corving that down below. (LINK TO AYATAN SCULPTUR)

And now with our frame and weapons modded and having had a look at the mod station we are ready to continue the quest.

---

**Chapter 7** Finishing Vors Prize - Foundry & Nav segment. (Crafting Explained)
---
As before, start the mission, complete it to retrieve the segment, and extract. Upon completion, you’ll receive a few mods and the **Foundry Segment**, which is essential for crafting items in Warframe. Go ahead and install the segment.

In the Foundry, all your blueprints will be displayed, and you can craft items if you have the necessary resources. This quest will guide you through the crafting process using the **Crafting Negator** as an example.

**Quick Tip:** When you hover over resources, you can see where they are commonly found.

For now, just follow the quest—it will guide you and provide the resources you need. Once you're ready, head back to the **Navigation menu** and start the next mission.

Once you’ve completed the mission, head back to the Foundry to craft the **Negator** and then begin the next mission to retrieve the **Nav Segment**.

After obtaining the Nav Segment, it’s finally time to take on **Captain Vor**. However, before starting the quest, it’s a good idea to upgrade your weapons and Warframe properly.

For example, I’ll max out **Serration** on the **Paris** to ensure it one-shots enemies and then randomly equip other mods where there’s space for now.

Once you’re ready, start the **Confront Captain Vor** mission. After defeating Vor and completing the mission, congratulations! You’ve finished the pre-tutorial of the game and now have semi-access to Warframe’s broader systems.

The next three chapters will cover some essential things I highly recommend obtaining before logging off for the day. Two of these will involve either a crafting cooldown or a waiting period.

---
**Chapter 8:** Saya's Vigill + Nightwave
---
Now that you’ve started the game, I recommend beginning with the **Saya’s Vigil** quest. Completing this quest is essential to unlock the junction to **Venus**, which we’ll cover in the next chapter. Venus Junction introduces a new planet and also marks the start of acquiring your first companion equipped with the **Vacuum** mod, commonly referred to as **auto loot**.

I won’t go over every detail of the quest, as I want to keep this guide spoiler-free for players who prefer to experience story quests on their own. However, I’ll highlight any parts that might require additional explanation, ensuring everything remains spoiler-free.

To start **Saya’s Vigil**, head to **Cetus**, the open-player hub on Earth, and speak with **Konzu** to begin the questline.

When you enter the open-world area, you can hold the map button to open a larger map and utilize the fast-travel points scattered across the area if needed.

### **Nightwave**

While completing missions, you’ll likely be introduced to **Nora’s Nightwave**, which is essentially Warframe’s **free battle pass**. You can access Nightwave from just behind the**Codex** in your Orbiter.

By completing **daily and weekly challenges**, you’ll earn standing to rank up in Nightwave. The rewards are excellent and include **weapon and Warframe slots**, mods, cosmetics, and more. I highly recommend tackling these challenges whenever possible to maximize your progress while playing.

Additionally, you’ll earn **Nightwave Creds**, a currency you can spend in the Nightwave shop. The shop offers **Orokin Catalysts** and **Reactors** to enhance weapon or Warframe capacity, as well as other useful mods and items. Be sure to check the shop regularly, as it rotates weekly.
### **Equipping the Codex Scanner**

To progress in **Saya’s Vigil**, you’ll need a **Codex Scanner** to complete a specific objective. If you’re unsure how to equip it:

1. Go to your **Arsenal** and select the **Gear Wheel** menu.
2. Add the Codex Scanner to a slot in your gear wheel.
3. I recommend purchasing at least 5 scanners initially (this provides 100 scans), which should be enough for now.

Once in the mission, you can hold **Q** (or your gear wheel button) to access and equip the scanner when needed.
### **Finishing Saya’s Vigil**

after equiping the scanner you can return to the mission toy need to complete but if you can find it you can always click the little mission box in the top right side to fast travel to the mission and start it.

---
**Chapter 9**: Junctions - Rushing to get your First companion
---
 **Venus Junction Preparation**
With **Saya’s Vigil** complete, you’re now ready to start the **Venus Junction** node. However, before proceeding, let’s upgrade your weapons and Warframe slightly.

This time, I recommend upgrading **Pressure Point** on your melee weapon to increase melee damage. Fill any remaining mod slots on your weapons and Warframe with mods that fit. Keep in mind that these upgrades won’t have a massive impact yet, as proper modding becomes more effective once you have more mods and mod capacity available.
### **Venus Junction Rewards**

Completing the **Venus Junction** will reward you with:

- The **Taxon** blueprint, your first companion capable of auto-looting with the **Vacuum** mod.
- An **Orokin Reactor** blueprint to boost Warframe capacity.
- Additional mods and access to **Venus** on the Star Chart.

Once you’re ready, start up the Venus Junction and complete it.
### **Crafting Taxon**

After completing the junction, head to the **Foundry** to check your available resources. If you’ve been actively looting during missions, you may already have **Neurodes**, a rare resource required to craft Taxon. Neurodes can be found on **Earth**, **Lua**, **Eris**, and **Deimos**, as indicated in the tooltips.

If you don’t have any Neurodes, I highly recommend farming **Marianna** on Earth. Focus on looking for Neurodes, and if you find one, repeat the mission until you have at least one to begin crafting Taxon.

Starting the Taxon blueprint early is important, as it takes **24 hours** to craft. By doing this, you’ll have your first companion ready to go for **Episode 2** of the Beginner Guide.

**Chapter 10**: Mastery  Mastery and Ranking up your Mastery. 
---
Mastery Rank Explained
At this point in the game you should have maxed out your Mastery XP and be able to rank up So lets go over Mastery and Ranking up your Mastery rank.,
The **Mastery Rank** is essentially your overall Warframe progression level, and here’s how it works:
- Each time you level up a Warframe, weapon, or any other item that can be ranked for the **first time**, you earn **Mastery XP**.
- To see your Mastery XP breakdown, open your profile tab and hover over the **Mastery** section. This will show how much XP each category has contributed.

**XP Breakdown**:

- Warframes, companions, Archwings, and Necramechs give more XP than weapons:
    - **Warframes, companions, Archwings, Necramechs** (Level 30): **6,000 XP**.
    - **Weapons** (Level 30): **3,000 XP**.
### **Maximizing Mastery XP**

To progress your Mastery Rank, always level up every weapon and frame to **max level (30)** at least once.

- Even if you don’t plan to use certain items, leveling them contributes to your rank.
- On this account, we won’t delete frames or weapons. Instead, we’ll farm Platinum to buy slots. This approach demonstrates how easy it is to expand your arsenal through in-game resources.
### **Ranking Up Your Mastery Rank**

Once you’ve accumulated enough Mastery XP to rank up:

1. Open your menu and begin the **Mastery Rank Test**.
2. Each test will challenge a different aspect of your gameplay.

Complete the test successfully, and congratulations—you’ve reached **Mastery Rank 1**! 
### **Additional Notes on Mastery Tests**

- You can only complete **one Mastery Rank test every 24 hours**.
- If you fail a test, you’ll need to wait 24 hours before retrying

**Chapter 11:** Joining a Clan (Our clan is called the Clemmunity)
---
### **Joining a Clan**

Before wrapping up, I highly recommend **joining a clan**. as you will get access to other players and place to trade and lots of clan specific items so If you’re interested, feel free to join **our clan, The Clemmunity**, as we’ve unlocked nearly everything you’ll need to progress.

To join:

1. **Join our Discord** (link in the description).
2. Navigate to the **Invite-To-Clan** channel.
3. Type in your in-game name, which you can find under your Warframe profile (as shown here).

One of the officers or I will send you an invite when we’re available.

Once the invite has been sent, you’ll find it in your **inbox** in Warframe. Simply accept it.

### **Accessing the Clan Dojo**

After accepting the invite:

1. Craft your **Clan Key** in the foundry.
2. Once crafted, you’ll gain access to the **Clan Dojo**, which we’ll be using in the next episode.

---

**Outro**
---
By now, you should have your **Taxon** and **Clan Key** crafting and be ready to venture to **Venus** to continue your adventure.

While you wait for the next episode in this series, I’ve got a little homework for you if you’re up for it:
- On **Earth**, there’s a **Spy mission** called **Cambria**.
    - Successfully clear all three vaults **without the timer running out** after being detected, and you’ll be rewarded with **Rotation C rewards**.
